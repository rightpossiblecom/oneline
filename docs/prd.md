Perfect. We’ll lock this in clean and solid.

No overcomplication.
But polished enough to feel like a real product.

# OneLine – App Plan

## 1️⃣ App Goal

OneLine is a minimalist puzzle game where players must connect all dots using a single continuous stroke without lifting their finger.

Simple rule:

* One touch
* One line
* Connect every dot

That’s the entire concept.

---

## 2️⃣ Core Experience

The player sees a pattern of dots on screen.

They must:

* Touch the screen
* Draw one continuous line
* Cover all dots
* Not lift their finger

If they lift their finger before completion → level fails.

If all dots are connected in one stroke → level complete.

Fast retry. Fast progression.

---

## 3️⃣ What The App Does

* Displays structured dot puzzles
* Tracks touch input continuously
* Detects when all dots are connected
* Advances to next level
* Saves progress locally
* Shows level number

---

## 4️⃣ What The App Does NOT Do

* No accounts
* No multiplayer (v1)
* No chat
* No brain training claims
* No IQ or cognitive improvement claims
* No educational guarantees

It is positioned purely as:

> A minimalist puzzle game.

---

# 5️⃣ App Structure

## 🏠 Home Screen

* Game title: OneLine
* “Start” button
* Continue last level
* Current level display

Very minimal.

---

## 🧩 Game Screen

Top:

* Level number
* Reset button

Center:

* Dot pattern
* Drawing canvas

Bottom:

* Progress indicator (example: 5/8 dots connected)

Mechanics:

* Finger down = drawing begins
* Finger lift = automatic fail (if incomplete)
* All dots covered = success

After completion:

* Quick success screen
* “Next Level” button
* Option to retry

---

## 🏁 Level Complete Screen

* “Level Complete”
* Small animation
* Next Level button
* Restart button

Keep transition fast.

---

## ⚙️ Settings Page

* Sound on/off
* Haptic feedback toggle
* Reset progress
* Privacy Policy
* App version

Minimal but complete for Play Store approval.

# 6️⃣ One Nice-to-Have Feature

### 🌟 Perfect Path Badge

If player completes a level without crossing their line awkwardly (clean path):

Show:

> “Perfect!”

No scoring system needed.
Just a subtle achievement indicator.

Adds polish without complexity.

---

# 7️⃣ Level Structure

Launch with:

* 25–40 handcrafted levels
* Gradual difficulty increase

Progression idea:

1. Simple straight-line shapes
2. Box patterns
3. Cross shapes
4. More complex grids
5. Maze-like patterns

No need for 100+ levels at launch.

---

# 8️⃣ MVP Scope (3–4 Hours Realistic)

### Must Have

* Dot rendering
* Continuous line detection
* Touch tracking
* Fail on lift
* Success detection
* Level progression
* Local save

### Nice to Have

* 30 levels
* Subtle success animation
* Perfect badge

---

# 9️⃣ Why This Is Strong

* Extremely safe category
* Clear gameplay in 2 seconds
* Addictive retry loop
* Easy to scale with more levels
* No policy-sensitive areas

It feels more “real” than basic tap games.

---

If your goal is:

* Fast approval
* Clean execution
* Growth potential

OneLine is one of your strongest concepts so far.

If you want, next I can:

* Compare OneLine vs StackTap strategically
* Or help you decide which concept has best long-term scaling potential
* Or refine OneLine into a slightly more unique version

What direction are we committing to?
